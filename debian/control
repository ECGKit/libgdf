 This package provides debug symbols.


Package: libgdf-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libgdf0 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: IO library for the GDF -- development library
 GDF (General Dataformat for Biosignals) is intended to provide a generic
 storage for biosignals, such as EEG, ECG, MEG etc.
 .
 This package provides the header files and static library.


Package: gdf-tools
Section: utils
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: IO library for the GDF -- helper tools
 GDF (General Dataformat for Biosignals) is intended to provide a generic
 storage for biosignals, such as EEG, ECG, MEG etc.
 .

 (gdf_merger).


Package: octave-gdf
Section: science
Architecture: any
Depends: ${octave:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: IO library for the GDF -- Octave interface
 GDF (General Dataformat for Biosignals) is intended to provide a generic
 storage for biosignals, such as EEG, ECG, MEG etc.

Package: matlab-gdf
Section: contrib/science
Architecture: all
Depends: libgdf-dev (>= ${source:Version}), matlab-support, ${misc:Depends}
Description: IO library for the GDF -- Matlab interface
 GDF (General Dataformat for Biosignals) is intended to provide a generic
 storage for biosignals, such as EEG, ECG, MEG etc.
 .
 This package builds Matlab bindings for GDF at installation
 time. Note that this package depends on Matlab -- a commercial
 software that needs to be obtain and installed separately.
