 Introduction
==============

libGDF is an implementation of "GDF - A General Dataformat for Biosignals Version V2.20" (See GDF Specification below). It consists of a library, tools and MATLAB bindings, all written in C++.

 Building libGDF
=================

a. General
libGDF is using cmake as build system. Out-of-Source builds are recommended. Libraries are built as shared by default. This can be changed at build time.
The default installation prefix is /usr/local.
For advanced configuration of the build process, please refer to the cmake documentation.

b. Linux:
		>> set BOOST_ROOT=/usr/include/boost
		>> cd path/to/toplevel/sourcedir
		>> mkdir build
		>> cd build
dynamic build:	>> cmake ..
static build:	>> cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
		>> make
		>> make install    

c. Windows:
	The following must be installed on the system:
		Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (or some other MSC version)
		Boost libraries www.boost.org
		libGDF

	Open a Command Prompt, then...

		> set BOOST_ROOT=C:\path\to\toplevel\of\boost
		> cd path/to/toplevel/sourcedir
		> mkdir build
		> cd build
		> cmake ..
		> GDF.sln

	The last command (or double-clicking the build/GDF.sln file) will launch
	the MSC development environment.

	In MSC, for Solution Configuration, select Release or Debug.
	In MSC, in Solution Explorer, right-click on ALL_BUILD, and select Build.
	If the build succeeds, in Solution Explorer, right-click on INSTALL, and select Build.

	The last step copies the new GDF library file(s) into sourcedir/lib .


 Building the MATLAB functions
===============================

a. libGDF was installed into the system
	At the MATLAB prompt:
		>> mex gdf_writer.cpp -lGDF
		>> mex gdf_reader.cpp -lGDF

b. libGDF was not installed
	First build libGDF as described above.
	At the MATLAB prompt:
		>> mex gdf_writer.cpp -Ipath/to/toplevel/sourcedir/libgdf/include -Lpath/to/build/dir/libgdf -lGDF
		>> mex gdf_reader.cpp -Ipath/to/toplevel/sourcedir/libgdf/include -Lpath/to/build/dir/libgdf -lGDF
