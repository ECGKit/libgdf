 Introduction
==============

libGDF is an implementation of "GDF - A General Dataformat for Biosignals Version V2.20" (See GDF Specification below). It consists of a library, tools and MATLAB bindings, all written in C++.


 License
=========
libGDF is licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007.


 Building libGDF
=================

a. General
libGDF is using cmake as build system. Out-of-Source builds are recommended. Libraries are built as shared by default. This can be changed at build time.
The default installation prefix is /usr/local.
For advanced configuration of the build process, please refer to the cmake documentation.

b. Linux:

		>> cd path/to/toplevel/sourcedir
		>> mkdir build
		>> cd build
dynamic build:	>> cmake ..
static build:	>> cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
		>> make
		>> make install

c. Windows:
	(TODO)


 Building the MATLAB functions
===============================

a. libGDF was installed into the system
	At the MATLAB prompt:
		>> mex gdf_writer.cpp -lGDF
		>> mex gdf_reader.cpp -lGDF

b. libGDF was not installed
	First build libGDF as described above.
	At the MATLAB prompt:
		>> mex gdf_writer.cpp -Ipath/to/toplevel/sourcedir/libgdf/include -Lpath/to/build/dir/libgdf -lGDF
		>> mex gdf_reader.cpp -Ipath/to/toplevel/sourcedir/libgdf/include -Lpath/to/build/dir/libgdf -lGDF
